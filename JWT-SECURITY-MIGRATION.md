# JWT Security Enhancement: Migration from localStorage to HTTP-Only Cookies

## Overview
Successfully migrated the application's JWT authentication from localStorage to secure HTTP-only cookies to mitigate XSS attack risks.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **routes/auth.cjs** - Enhanced Authentication Routes
- **Modified `/api/auth/login`**: Now sets JWT in HTTP-only, secure cookie instead of returning token in response body
  - Added `httpOnly: true` for XSS protection
  - Added `secure: true` for production HTTPS
  - Added `sameSite: 'strict'` for CSRF protection
  - Added `maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (24 hours) for automatic expiration

- **Added `/api/auth/logout`**: New endpoint to clear authentication cookie
  - Clears `authToken` cookie with matching security attributes
  - Returns success confirmation

- **Added `/api/auth/me`**: New endpoint to get current user information
  - Uses authentication middleware to verify cookie-based session
  - Returns user profile without exposing sensitive data

#### 2. **middleware/auth.cjs** - Updated Authentication Middleware
- **Enhanced token extraction**: Now reads from cookies first, falls back to Authorization header for backwards compatibility
- Uses `req.cookies.authToken` for cookie-based authentication
- Maintains existing JWT verification logic

#### 3. **server.cjs** - Added Cookie Support
- **Added `cookie-parser` middleware**: Required for parsing HTTP cookies
- **Updated CORS configuration**: 
  - More restrictive origin policy for production security
  - Maintains `credentials: true` for cookie transmission

#### 4. **models/userModel.cjs** - Enhanced User Model
- **Added `findById` method**: Required for `/api/auth/me` endpoint to fetch user details by ID

### Frontend Changes

#### 5. **src/api.js** - Refactored API Client
- **Removed manual Authorization header logic**: No longer needed with cookie-based auth
- **Added `credentials: 'include'`**: Ensures cookies are sent with all API requests
- **Simplified request headers**: Removed token management complexity
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) now use cookie-based authentication

#### 6. **src/portfolioStore.js** - Updated State Management
- **Removed localStorage usage**: No longer stores or retrieves tokens from localStorage
- **Removed JWT decoding**: No longer needs `jwt-decode` library
- **Updated `login` method**: Now calls backend API and stores user info from response
- **Updated `logout` method**: Now calls backend logout endpoint to clear cookie
- **Updated `checkAuth` method**: Now calls `/api/auth/me` to verify session status
- **Removed token from state**: Simplified authentication state to just `user` and `isAuthenticated`

#### 7. **src/LoginPage.jsx** - Updated Login Flow
- **Modified login handler**: Now uses store's async `login` method instead of manual token handling
- **Simplified error handling**: Leverages centralized authentication logic

#### 8. **src/App.jsx** - Minor Logout Update
- **Updated logout button**: Now properly calls async logout function

### Security Improvements

#### XSS Protection
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JavaScript cannot access authentication tokens, preventing XSS attacks from stealing credentials
- **No localStorage exposure**: Tokens no longer accessible via client-side scripts

#### CSRF Protection
- **SameSite=Strict**: Prevents cookies from being sent in cross-site requests
- **Secure flag**: Ensures cookies only sent over HTTPS in production

#### Session Management
- **Automatic expiration**: Cookies expire after 24 hours
- **Server-side logout**: Properly clears authentication state on server

### Development & Testing

#### 9. **test-auth-cookies.js** - Authentication Test Suite
- **Comprehensive test script**: Verifies complete authentication flow
- **Tests login, protected route access, logout, and post-logout security**
- **Validates cookie-based authentication works correctly**

### Package Dependencies
- **Added `cookie-parser`**: Backend dependency for parsing HTTP cookies
- **Added `node-fetch`**: Development dependency for testing authentication flow
- **Removed dependency on client-side JWT handling**

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Resistance**: Tokens cannot be accessed by malicious JavaScript
2. **CSRF Protection**: SameSite policy prevents cross-site request forgery
3. **Secure Transport**: Tokens only sent over HTTPS in production
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Cookies cleared properly on logout
5. **Session Control**: Server-side token validation and revocation

## Backwards Compatibility

The authentication middleware maintains backwards compatibility by checking for tokens in both cookies and Authorization headers during the transition period.

## Testing

Run the authentication test suite:
```bash
npm start  # Start the server
node test-auth-cookies.js  # Run authentication tests
```

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Authorization header fallback** after confirming all clients use cookie-based auth
2. **Implement refresh tokens** for enhanced security with shorter-lived access tokens
3. **Add rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
4. **Implement proper session management** with session storage if needed for more complex scenarios

The migration successfully enhances the application's security posture while maintaining functionality and user experience.
