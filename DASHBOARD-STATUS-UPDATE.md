# Revenue by Contract Status Dashboard Updates - COMPLETE ✅

## Changes Made

### Problem
The Dashboard's "Revenue by Contract Status" chart was:
1. Using old status codes ('IF', 'P', 'D', 'H') that didn't match client card labels
2. The chart title didn't clarify it shows 2025 revenue only

### Solution
Updated the dashboard to show **2025 Revenue Only** with **Client Card Status Labels**.

## Files Modified

### 1. Frontend Dashboard (`src/DashboardView.jsx`)

**Revenue Calculation Logic:**
- Changed status categories from `{'IF': 0, 'P': 0, 'D': 0, 'H': 0}` to `{'Active': 0, 'Prospect': 0, 'Inactive': 0, 'Former': 0}`
- Added mapping for legacy status codes:
  - 'IF' → 'Active' (In Force becomes Active)
  - 'P' → 'Prospect' (Proposal remains Prospect) 
  - 'D' → 'Former' (Done becomes Former)
  - 'H' → 'Inactive' (Hold becomes Inactive)

**Visual Updates:**
- Updated chart title from "Revenue by Contract Status" to "**2025 Revenue by Contract Status**"
- Added color mappings for new status labels:
  - Active: Green (#22c55e)
  - Prospect: Blue (#3b82f6)  
  - Inactive: Gray (#6b7280)
  - Former: Orange (#f59e0b)

### 2. Backend API (`data.cjs`)

**Analytics Endpoint:**
- Updated `/api/data/analytics` revenue calculation to use new status labels
- Added same status mapping logic for backward compatibility
- Updated `statusBreakdown` to count clients using both old and new status values

## Revenue Data Source

✅ **Confirmed**: The revenue calculation already uses **2025 data only** via:
- `usePortfolioStore.getState().getClientRevenue(client)` - returns 2025 revenue from client.revenues array
- `client.averageRevenue` - calculated by `calculateStrategicScores()` using only 2025 data

## Status Label Alignment

✅ **Confirmed**: Dashboard status buttons now match Client Card labels:

| Dashboard Chart | Client Card | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Active**     | Active      | Current/active clients |
| **Prospect**   | Prospect    | Potential new clients |
| **Inactive**   | Inactive    | Temporarily inactive |
| **Former**     | Former      | Previous clients |

## Testing

✅ **Verified** via `test-status-mapping.cjs`:
- Revenue shows 2025 data only
- Legacy status codes properly mapped  
- New labels display correctly
- Total calculations accurate

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Maintained**:
- Old status codes still work via mapping
- API responses include both formats
- No breaking changes to existing data

## Result

The Dashboard now displays:
1. **2025 Revenue by Contract Status** (clear title)
2. **Active, Prospect, Inactive, Former** buttons (matching client cards)
3. **Accurate 2025-only revenue totals** by each status category

**Status: COMPLETE** ✅
